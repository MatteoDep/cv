\section{Experience}

\cventry{Jul 2020 -\\Jul 2021}{Software Engineer (Part Time)}{Agri Data innovations}{
	Maintained and developed computer vision and data analysis code (improved the code I worked on my previous internship).\\
	Trained and Tuned instance segmentation neural network.\\
	Used the TensorFlow Object Detection API to train and test different models and compare results.\\
	Worked on refactoring of scripts and libraries.\\
	Supervised interns.\\
}

\cventry{Jan 2020 -\\Jul 2020}{Internship}{Agri Data innovations}{
	Built and collaborated on a variety of computer vision and data analysis software.\\
	Fine-tuned and tested instance segmentation neural network and implemented API to use it for leaves segmentation.\\
	Used the API for other applications, like tracking leaves growth over time.\\
}

\cventry{Mar 2019 -\\Aug 2019}{Internship}{Witted s.r.l.}{
	I built a dynamics model in Matlab-Simulink which fits for an underwater robot with any number of thrusters, using all the 6 coupled DOFs and without constraints on the various parameters
	(e.g. center of mass, center of buoyancy, inertia matrix, etc...).\\
	I developed and tested a new method for measuring the 3-dimensional center of mass.\\
	I had the opportunity to improve soft skills like learning how to write a proposal, time management, properly documenting my work, designing of an experiment and how to make effective presentations.\\
}

\section{Education}

\cventry{Sep 2020 -\\Oct 2022}{MSc in Applied Physics}{Delft University of Technology}{
	During my Master I dived deeper in the topics of Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics and Solide State Physics,
	as well as gaining practical knowledge on physics applications in the renewable energy domain and quantum devices.
	My Master Thesis investigates \textit{Electron Transport in Cable Bacteria}, in particular, I explore the temperature and gate dependence of the conductance that is displayed in these microorganisms.
	Along the journey I had the opportunity to improve my analysis and critical thinking skills, team working and communication, as well as improving my knowledge of C++ and Python.
	Supervisor: H.J.S. van der Zant.
